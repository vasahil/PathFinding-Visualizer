# Pathfinding Visualizer  
Visualize how common pathfinding algorithms explore and solve for shortest paths.

List algorithms with a short description, e.g.:

Breadth‑First Search (BFS) – explores equally in all directions; finds shortest paths in unweighted graphs.

Depth‑First Search (DFS) – explores deeply before backtracking; does not always find the shortest path.

Dijkstra – weighted graph shortest‑path guarantee.

A* – heuristic‑guided, faster than Dijkstra when target is known; weighted, shortest‑path guaranteed.
